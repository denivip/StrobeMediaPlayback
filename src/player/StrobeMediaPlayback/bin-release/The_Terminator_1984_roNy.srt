00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,370
LOS ANGELES 2029 A.D.

2
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,450
THE MACHINES ROSE FROM THE
ASHES OF THE NUCLEAR FIRE.

3
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,280
THEIR WAR TO EXTERMINATE MANKIND
HAS RAGED FOR DECADES,

4
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,910
BUT THE FINAL BATTLE WOULD NOT
BE FOUGHT IN THE FUTURE.

5
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,750
IT WOULD BE FOUGHT HERE,
IN OUR PRESENT.

6
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,880
TONIGHT...

7
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,960
LOS ANGELES 1984
1:52a.m.

8
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,180
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

9
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,700
What the hell...?

10
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey, my turn.

11
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,970
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

12
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,980
Nice night for a walk?

13
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,120
Nice night for a walk.

14
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,250
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

15
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,210
Nothing clean. Right.

16
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,420
I think this guy's a couple of cans
short of a six-pack.

17
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,750
Your clothes, give them to me.

18
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,800
- Now.
- Fuck you, asshole.

19
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,610
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

20
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,950
- See that guy?
- Hold it right there.

21
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,580
- He's rabbiting.
- Hey! I said hold it! Go.

22
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,750
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

23
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,760
- What day is it? The date.
- 1 2th May.

24
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,840
- Thursday.
- What year?

25
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,070
He's got my gun. Let's go.

26
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,660
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

27
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,290
Hi. I'm late.

28
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,380
So am I.

29
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,260
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

30
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,770
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

31
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,640
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

32
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,850
That's mine, but I didn't order fries.

33
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,320
- Mine's the chilli beef deluxe.
- Who gets the burly-beef?

34
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,320
- We're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

35
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,860
I'm so sorry.

36
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,990
This isn't real leather, is it?

37
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,380
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

38
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,260
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

39
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,060
The 1 2-gauge auto-loader.

40
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,110
That's ltalian. You can go pump or auto.

41
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,690
The 45 long slide with laser sighting.

42
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,280
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

43
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,660
The beam comes on - you put the red dot
where you want the bullet to go.

44
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,830
You can't miss.

45
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,380
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

46
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,210
Hey, just what you see, pal.

47
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,920
The Uzi nine millimetre.

48
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,510
You know your weapons, buddy.

49
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,930
Any one of these is ideal
for home defence.

50
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,970
So which will it be?

51
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,690
- All.
- I may close early today.

52
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,110
It's a 1 5-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

53
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,280
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

54
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,970
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

55
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,310
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

56
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,730
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

57
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,690
Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

58
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,120
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

59
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,350
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

60
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,190
Sarah, come here. It's about you.
I mean, sort of.

61
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,860
Incredible. You're not gonna believe this.
You're going to love this.

62
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,860
- What?
- ..compiled from several witnesses.

63
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,280
Once again, Sarah Connor,
35, mother oftwo,

64
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,830
brutally shot to death this afternoon.

65
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,200
You're dead, honey.

66
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,190
..if you're into sound,

67
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,650
for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.

68
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,910
We've got woofers, tweeters,
the newest in audio and compact discs.

69
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,410
We've got graphic equalisers
and sound balancers that...

70
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,560
Sorry.

71
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,200
Hello?

72
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,540
First I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one,

73
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,000
then run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.

74
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:15,510
And then slowly... slowly pull
yourjeans offinch by inch.

75
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,840
Ginger, it's Matt.

76
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,100
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

77
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,480
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

78
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,100
Who is this?

79
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,400
God. Sarah?

80
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,530
Jesus. I'm sorry.

81
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,280
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger?

82
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,860
Sure.

83
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,540
It's the creep.

84
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,870
Hello?

85
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,500
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

86
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,420
You fucking pigs. Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me.

87
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,390
Ed.

88
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,850
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

89
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,600
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

90
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,440
Shot six times at less than 10 feet.
Large calibre weapon.

91
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,610
You know, these work.

92
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,570
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

93
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,990
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

94
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,950
Are you sure there's a point to all of this?

95
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,450
Look at the name, Ed.

96
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,290
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

97
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,290
You're kidding.

98
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,050
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

99
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,550
- A one-day pattern killer.
- I hate the weird ones.

100
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,970
So...

101
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,850
Better than mortal man deserves.

102
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,320
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately. Did you check messages?

103
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,830
I thought you did.

104
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,080
- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.

105
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,460
You mind your mother.

106
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,720
Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.

107
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,600
Looks like I won't be able to make it
tonight. Just can't get out ofit.

108
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,440
I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.
Call you in a day or so. Bye.

109
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,270
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

110
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,070
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

111
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,240
I'll live.

112
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,620
I'll break his kneecaps.

113
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,120
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

114
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,790
God. It's disgusting.

115
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,710
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

116
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,720
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

117
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,060
Damn it, Matt.

118
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,740
Shit.

119
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,990
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

120
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,460
- What can I tell you? No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...

121
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,090
That coffee's two hours cold.

122
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,600
I put a cigarette out in it.

123
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,230
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I got her answering machine.

124
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,900
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer.

125
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,360
- The apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

126
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,360
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

127
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,530
Give me a cigarette.

128
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,460
Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

129
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,670
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...

130
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,510
Same shit.

131
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:20,270
I can hear it now. He's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

132
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,610
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

133
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,820
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

134
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,950
Maybe make these jackals work for us.

135
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,870
If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock,
maybe she'll call us.

136
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,620
Well, how do I look?

137
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,080
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

138
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,380
This just in. Police have announced
the name ofthe victim

139
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,010
in the second oftwo murders
which took place today.

140
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,550
Incredibly, the names ofthe
two victims are virtually identical.

141
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,850
Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead...

142
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,230
- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise...

143
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,860
Don't touch it.

144
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,450
Police are refusing to speculate on the
similarity between the shooting deaths

145
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,870
and no other connection between
the two victims has been established yet.

146
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,790
We'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.

147
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,750
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

148
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,340
Hey. Four-fifty.

149
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,800
You have reached the Los Angeles
Police emergency number.

150
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:42,680
All lines are busy. Ifyou need a police car
sent out to you, stay on the line.

151
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:51,040
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

152
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,970
Don't make me bust you up, man.

153
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,040
Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

154
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,120
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.

155
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:19,340
So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.

156
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,010
Wait for the beep.

157
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,470
This is Sarah. Pick up ifyou're there.

158
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,390
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.

159
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:35,560
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

160
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,270
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

161
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,780
The police keep transferring me.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

162
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:49,200
The number here is 555 9175.
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.

163
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,510
It's her.

164
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,140
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

165
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,600
Don't put me on hold.
Don't transfer me to another department.

166
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,980
I won't. Can you tell me where you are?

167
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,060
- I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
- I know it. It's on Pico.

168
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,900
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

169
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,110
- I think there's a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.

170
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,040
You're in a public place so you'll be safe.
Stay visible. Don't go outside.

171
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,250
- I'll have a car there in a minute.
- OK.

172
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,230
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

173
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,350
Come with me if you wanna live.

174
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,490
Come on!

175
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,900
This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony.

176
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,360
Suspect vehicle - Iate model
grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.

177
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,650
He's really moving - punching lights.

178
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,530
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

179
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,910
Hold it.

180
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,510
Hold on.

181
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,230
Are you injured? Are you shot?

182
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,870
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

183
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,500
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

184
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,920
Do you understand?

185
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,590
- Do you understand?
- Yes. Please don't hurt me.

186
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,610
I'm here to help you.

187
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:40,400
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.

188
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,860
You've been targeted for termination.

189
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:57,250
This is one-L-19. Westbound
on Olympic. Approaching Overland.

190
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,840
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

191
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,680
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

192
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:12,310
This isn't true. How could that man
just get up after you...

193
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,350
It's not a man. A machine.

194
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,980
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101 .

195
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,160
A machine? Like a robot?

196
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,830
Not a robot. A cyborg -
cybernetic organism.

197
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,790
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

198
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,630
Get your head down.

199
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,140
Listen. The Terminator's an infiltration
unit. Part man, part machine.

200
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:38,190
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat
chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

201
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,780
Fully armoured, very tough.
Outside it's living human tissue.

202
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,240
Flesh, skin, hair, blood -
grown for the cyborgs.

203
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,200
- Look, Reese, I don't know...
- Pay attention.

204
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,790
I gotta ditch this car.

205
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,080
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

206
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,710
But these are new. They look human.

207
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,670
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

208
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,390
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

209
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:17,180
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

210
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:21,230
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

211
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,900
Are you saying it's from the future?

212
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,740
One possible future...
from your point of view.

213
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,990
I don't know tech stuff.

214
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,870
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

215
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,040
- Right.
- Right.

216
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:51,590
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

217
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,720
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

218
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,310
That Terminator is out there.

219
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,360
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

220
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,190
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear

221
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:14,280
and it absolutely will not stop,
ever, until you are dead.

222
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,250
Can you stop it?

223
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,550
I don't know.

224
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,010
With these weapons, I don't know.

225
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:56,950
All units. Ford suspect vehicle has
been found in a parking structure...

226
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,920
Reese, why me?

227
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,710
Why does it want me?

228
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,680
There was a nuclear war.

229
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,520
A few years from now,

230
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:09,270
all this, this whole place, everything,

231
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,990
it's gone, just gone.

232
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,820
There were survivors.

233
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,990
Here, there.

234
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,750
Nobody even knew who started it.

235
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,710
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

236
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,380
Defence network computers.

237
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,220
New, powerful,

238
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:44,140
hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

239
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,810
They say it got smart -
a new order of intelligence.

240
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,650
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

241
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,660
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

242
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,200
Extermination.

243
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,630
Did you see this war?

244
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:35,190
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

245
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,400
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

246
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,410
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

247
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:45,450
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

248
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:50,210
Most of us were rounded up.
Put in camps for orderly disposal.

249
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,210
This was burned in by laser scanner.

250
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:02,220
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

251
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,970
Loading bodies.

252
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,810
The disposal units ran night and day.

253
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,980
We were that close to going out for ever.

254
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,740
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

255
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,900
To storm the wire of the camps.

256
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,620
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

257
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,870
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

258
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,330
His name was Connor. John Connor.

259
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,090
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

260
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,620
Drive.

261
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:38,630
Reese!

262
00:49:56,810 --> 00:50:00,270
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

263
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,190
You in the Cadillac,
let me see your hands now.

264
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,110
Get out of the car.

265
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,620
Drop to your knees.

266
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,040
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

267
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,740
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

268
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,540
Listen, are you sure it's them?

269
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,660
I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

270
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:02,000
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

271
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:09,170
Ginger. Kiddo.

272
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,930
- Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

273
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:19,100
Tell him everything Reese told you,
Sarah. Do you feel up to that?

274
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,270
Yeah, I guess so.

275
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:27,070
- You're a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.

276
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:31,990
- Is Reese crazy?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

277
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:00,200
So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

278
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:06,920
With the 1 32nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

279
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,840
That's the year 2027?

280
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,010
That's right. Then I was assigned...

281
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,930
- This is fucking great.
- ..under John Connor.

282
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,140
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defence system...

283
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,560
Goddamn! Sorry.

284
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,190
..built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

285
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,350
I see.

286
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,280
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

287
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,700
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

288
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,070
A sort of retroactive abortion?

289
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,080
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

290
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,290
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

291
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,130
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

292
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,750
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

293
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,340
It had no choice.
Their defence grid was smashed.

294
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:00,850
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

295
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,890
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

296
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:08,810
Is that when you captured the lab
complex and found... What is it called?

297
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,400
The time displacement equipment?

298
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,360
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

299
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:18,530
Connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place.

300
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,370
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

301
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,490
I can't.

302
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:29,750
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

303
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,420
It's just him and me.

304
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,360
It's just him and me.

305
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:29,540
Why didn't you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.

306
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,540
Don't you have ray guns?

307
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:36,210
- Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.

308
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:41,010
You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.

309
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:44,840
Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.

310
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:49,470
OK, OK. But this cyborg, ifit's metal... ?

311
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,100
- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.

312
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:56,060
Great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

313
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:59,150
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

314
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:03,900
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

315
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,740
- Why were the other women killed?
- Records were lost in the war.

316
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:11,580
Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.

317
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,370
Her full name, where she lived.
Theyjust knew the city.

318
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,380
The Terminator was
just being systematic.

319
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,300
- Let's go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.

320
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:24,760
I have answered your questions.
I have to see Sarah Connor.

321
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,720
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

322
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,890
- Who is in authority here?
- Please...

323
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:33,060
Shut up!

324
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,890
You still don't get it, do you?

325
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:41,230
He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does.

326
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:46,950
You can't stop him. He'll reach down
her throat and pull her fucking heart out!

327
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,580
- Doc.
- Let go ofme!

328
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,910
Sorry.

329
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,340
He's crazy?

330
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,880
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

331
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:10,970
Sarah, this is what they call body armour.
Our TAC guys wear these.

332
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,350
It'll stop a 1 2-gauge round.

333
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:17,730
This other man must've been wearing
one under his coat. Feel that.

334
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:23,530
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.

335
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,360
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it.

336
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:28,950
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

337
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,120
Thank you.

338
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,830
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.

339
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,500
Be at least an hour
before your mother gets here.

340
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,790
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

341
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,050
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

342
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,510
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

343
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,640
Thank you.

344
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,480
- Good night.
- Good night.

345
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:19,620
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

346
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,290
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

347
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,040
Where is she?

348
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:28,920
It make take a while. If you wanna wait,
there's a bench over there.

349
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,480
I'll be back.

350
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,120
Stay here.

351
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:19,450
Watch him.

352
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,520
Ed...

353
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,510
Sarah!

354
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,640
Reese.

355
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,180
This way.

356
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:49,390
KFLB news time. 4.36.

357
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,810
Top story - the largest single
law enforcement mobilisation

358
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,020
in California history
is currently underway.

359
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:00,030
Police in five counties are engaged
in a massive manhunt for...

360
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,530
Take this.

361
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,660
All right. Let's get this off the road.

362
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:44,820
- You cold?
- Freezing.

363
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,670
Reese?

364
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,050
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

365
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:09,770
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

366
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,600
White light.

367
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,860
Pain.

368
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:25,660
- It's like being born maybe.
- My God.

369
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,580
I caught one back there.

370
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,830
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

371
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:37,380
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

372
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:42,420
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

373
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:56,230
Jesus.

374
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:58,940
See? It passed right through the meat.

375
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,480
This is gonna make me puke.

376
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:04,780
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

377
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:09,450
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

378
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,330
He's about my height.

379
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,790
He has your eyes.

380
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,920
What's he like?

381
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:26,760
You trust him. He's got a strength.

382
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:30,550
I'd die for John Connor.

383
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:36,940
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

384
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:42,860
Don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost?

385
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,860
John never said much about him.

386
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:49,070
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

387
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:53,240
I don't wanna know.

388
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:56,750
So was it John that sent you here?

389
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:59,580
I volunteered.

390
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:04,510
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

391
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:11,470
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organise,

392
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,760
prepare from when he was a kid.

393
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:17,600
When you were in hiding before the war.

394
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:23,480
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

395
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:26,150
It's driving me crazy.

396
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:31,910
Are you sure you have the right person?

397
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:34,200
I'm sure.

398
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:38,250
Come on! Do I look like
the mother of the future?

399
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:45,000
I mean, am I tough? Organised?
I can't even balance my chequebook.

400
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:52,050
Look, Reese, I didn't ask
for this honour and I don't want it.

401
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,510
Any of it.

402
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,810
Your son gave me a message
to give to you. Made me memorise it.

403
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:05,020
Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years.

404
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:09,820
I can't help you with what you must
soon face. The future is not set.

405
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:12,490
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

406
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:15,950
You must survive or I will never exist.

407
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,120
That's all.

408
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,750
It's a good field dressing.

409
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,920
You like it?

410
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,300
It's my first.

411
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,550
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

412
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,560
OK.

413
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,650
Talk to me some more.

414
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:58,080
About what?

415
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,910
Tell me about where you're from.

416
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,920
All right.

417
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:10,840
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

418
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,140
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

419
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:22,430
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

420
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:26,020
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

421
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,820
The Terminators were the newest.
The worst.

422
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:44,790
Traversing your sector in search mode.
750 metres north ofyour position.

423
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,380
Let's go.

424
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,050
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

425
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:13,980
Terminator!

426
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,640
I was dreaming about dogs.

427
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,860
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

428
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,860
Your world is pretty terrifying.

429
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:22,690
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

430
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,120
Fuck you, asshole.

431
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,930
God damn.

432
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:55,430
Thank you.

433
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:02,900
Is this enough?

434
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:07,150
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

435
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:14,450
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

436
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,710
- With a kitchen.
- Do you have one with a kitchen?

437
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:36,390
I am dying for a shower.

438
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:40,900
We should check your bandage, too.

439
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:44,570
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

440
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:50,490
Keep this.

441
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:18,980
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

442
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,190
I need to know where to reach you.

443
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:26,530
You tell me to hide out at the cabin
and you won't tell me what's going on?

444
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:28,900
I am worried sick here.

445
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:33,570
OK. OK, here's the number.

446
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,990
- You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

447
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:42,670
It's 408 555 1439. Room nine.

448
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:44,670
- Got it?
- I've got it.

449
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:49,170
I gotta go. I'm sorry
I can't tell you more right now.

450
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,340
I love you, Mom.

451
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:57,180
I love you, too, sweetheart.

452
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:11,650
- Tiki Motel.
- Give me your address there.

453
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,370
What have we got?

454
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:26,130
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.

455
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,500
What's for dinner?

456
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:31,800
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.

457
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,970
What is it?

458
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:37,680
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

459
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:40,680
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

460
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:54,400
Make sure there's none on the threads.

461
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:57,950
Like this.

462
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:01,660
Screw the end cap on.

463
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,420
Very gently.

464
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,920
You must've had a fun childhood.

465
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:15,340
That's good.

466
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:20,430
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

467
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:33,030
He'll find us, won't he?

468
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,320
Probably.

469
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,430
It'll never be over, will it?

470
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:07,600
Look at me. I'm shaking.

471
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:13,820
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

472
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:18,570
No, I'm not.

473
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:31,710
Kyle, the women in your time,

474
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,130
what are they like?

475
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:39,090
Good fighters.

476
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:41,930
That's not what I meant.

477
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:45,930
Was there someone special?

478
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:49,230
Someone...?

479
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,610
A girl, you know.

480
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:55,150
No.

481
01:19:57,490 --> 01:19:59,530
Never.

482
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:02,660
Never?

483
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,500
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

484
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,710
So much pain.

485
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,340
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

486
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:24,810
So you feel nothing?

487
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:32,060
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

488
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:36,820
I didn't know why at the time.

489
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:42,950
It was very old, torn, faded.

490
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:53,130
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

491
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:58,380
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

492
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:02,010
I memorised every line,

493
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:04,180
every curve.

494
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,390
I came across time for you, Sarah.

495
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,730
I love you. I always have.

496
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:36,080
I shouldn't have said that.

497
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:09,090
Think fast.

498
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,640
Trade places.

499
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:53,620
Faster. Drive faster.

500
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:46,420
Kyle. Oh, my God.

501
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:56,490
You stay here.

502
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,350
Let's get outta here.

503
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:26,390
Get out.

504
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:45,450
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

505
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:56,630
Come on.

506
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,590
Help me. Get out. Get out.

507
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:27,250
Don't stop. Run.

508
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:41,710
Sarah.

509
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,670
Kyle.

510
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,190
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

511
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:17,000
No.

512
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,230
Wait.

513
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:23,190
What are you doing?

514
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,650
Cover, so he can't track us.

515
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,620
Come on.

516
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:43,130
No. Kyle. Come on.

517
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,090
- Come on.
- Leave me here.

518
01:32:56,810 --> 01:33:01,440
Move it, Reese. On your feet, soldier.

519
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:05,020
On your feet. Move it.

520
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:19,140
Get back. Go back.

521
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:55,380
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

522
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:57,260
Run.

523
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:02,350
Run.

524
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:05,100
Come on, motherfucker.

525
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:59,380
No.

526
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,300
You're terminated, fucker.

527
01:39:57,690 --> 01:39:59,730
Kyle.

528
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:23,750
Seven. November 10. Where was l?

529
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,760
What's difficult is trying to decide
what to tell you and what not to.

530
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:33,600
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

531
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:38,690
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

532
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,680
Fill her up.

533
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,730
Should I tell you about your father?

534
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:25,110
Boy, that's a tough one.

535
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:32,280
Will it effect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

536
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:36,120
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.

537
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:39,330
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

538
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,460
I suppose I will tell you.

539
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:48,840
I owe him that.

540
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:53,470
Maybe it'll help if...

541
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:58,770
you know that in the few hours
that we had together,

542
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,270
we loved a lifetime's worth.

543
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:19,620
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful.

544
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:22,830
He is ashamed to ask you
for five dollars for this picture.

545
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,290
But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.

546
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:29,420
Pretty good hustle, kid.

547
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,770
What did he just say?

548
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,980
He said there's a storm coming in.

549
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:56,530
I know.
